# PizzaPizzaRandomizer
To help you decide what to order

Sometimes you don't know what to order at Pizza Pizza. The Pizza Pizza website itself does not have a randomization function. That is where the Pizza Pizza Randomizer comes in. It will generate for you a pizza which you can order at your local Pizza Pizza. 

Here is a sample of a tasty pizza you can create:
- You're getting a Small pizza!
- Your dough is Whole Grain Regular crust
- Your base sauce is: Home Style Italian Tomato Sauce
- Your base cheese is: Four Cheese Base
- Left side's special topping #1 is: Chipotle Steak (4X)
- Left side's special topping #2 is: Feta Cheese (3X)
- Right side's special topping #1 is: Spinach (2X)

The author makes no guarantees about the price of the resulting pizza.
